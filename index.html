        <p>Buffalo-Niagara is one of the most racially segregated metropolitan areas in the country (Blatto). Entangled in deep histories of racial tension, the geography of Buffalo is shaped by a history of policy decisions aimed at racial segregation.</p>
        <p>Anna Blatto, a part-time researcher for the <a href="https://ppgbuffalo.org/" target="_blank">Partnership for the Public Good</a> and who has done extensive <a href="https://ppgbuffalo.org/files/documents/data-demographics-history/a_city_divided__a_brief_history_of_segregation_in_the_city_of_buffalo.pdf" target="_blank">research</a> on Buffalo’s history of segregation, explained that these policies- a combination of federal, state, and local- were extremely intentional with separating black residents from white, forcing black populations into neighborhoods with substandard housing.</p>
        <p>Nearly 85% of the black population in Buffalo live east of Main Street (Blatto). These neighborhoods are subjected to poorer conditions and less access to necessary services, limiting movement for residents within these areas.<p>
        <p> <iframe title="Buffalo neighborhoods by black population" aria-label="Map" id="datawrapper-chart-dAMnb" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/dAMnb/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="801" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();</script></p>
        <p>The concentration of black Buffalo residents is entirely exclusive to east of Main Street- no other neighborhood beyond the East Side represents a shade of blue. South Buffalo shows the lowest amounts of black residents, with each neighborhood having a percentage below ten.</p>
        <p>There is a clear-cut line- the outline of Main Street- that explicitly divides black residents from other communities. Neighborhoods geographically next to each other have drastically different percentages of black residents. 
        <p>“There are very measurable social determinants,” Blatto said. “There are two particular neighborhoods, Fillmore-Leroy and Central Park, that are geographically next to each other but have very different statistics.”</p>
        <p> Fillmore-Leroy has an average of 80% black residents while Central Park, directly north of Fillmore-Leroy, has an average of 15%. This is nearly a fifth of Fillmore-Leroy’s black population. The same pattern continues for every neighborhood divided by Main Street. </p>
        <p>How can two neighborhoods have such drastically different statistics, despite sharing the same border? </p>
        <p> Blatto explained the rigorous series of housing policies that had the direct intention of displacing black residents. In the early 1900s, Buffalo actually had well-connected neighborhoods and integrated populations, with reports showing black residents even living in the same building as white residents (Blatto).  However, after the Great Migration, an influx of black migrants escaping the Jim Crow South resided in northern cities in search of manufacturing jobs. Housing policies such as restrictive covenants, blockbusting, and redlining were then implemented to make neighborhood compositions homogeneous by race, Blatto said.</p>
        <p>Present day, the lasting effects of these discriminatory policies are extremely visible and especially detrimental to Buffalo’s black population.</p>
        <p>“There are a lot of significant disparities between populations in the region,” Blatto said. “The concentration of poverty in the city of Buffalo heavily affects the black population- this then plays into health-related disparities, education disparities, etc.”</p>

        <p><iframe title="Buffalo's East Side has the city's highest poverty rates" aria-label="Bar chart" id="datawrapper-chart-aTrhf" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/aTrhf/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="212" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();</script></p>

        <p>East Side leads with the highest rates of poverty with an average of 36.79%. With the East Side consisting of 85% of Buffalo’s black population, this means that high amounts of black residents predominantly live in poverty.</p>
        <p>However, the West Side shows the second highest amounts of poverty in Buffalo, despite having very low rates of black residents. Its poverty rates come close to the East Side, with an average of 35.51%.</p>
        <p>The West Side consists of large populations of refugees and immigrants, Blatto said. Blatto also added that currently, “the West Side is one of those areas that I would consider to be gentrifying at the fastest rate.”</p>
        <p>The West Side is right near Downtown Buffalo; a push to value, as Blatto explained, is often assigned to areas where gentrification occurs. Currently, most parts of the East Side have remained not gentrified.</p>
        <p>Blatto explained that there are large areas of vacant land owned by the city in the East Side. The city determined in the early decade that it was “less expensive and more effective to bulldoze entire city blocks” instead of developing areas of the community (Blatto).</p>
        <p>“This is a stark contrast to other areas like the West Side which are extremely dense, where there are houses everywhere,” Blatto said. “You are able to know which neighborhoods have what demographics just by driving around.”</p>
        <p>The West Side’s fast-paced gentrification and the East Side’s straggling development, despite having similar poverty rates, is a testament to the generational impact of policy decisions made in the past.</p>
        <p>“People who live in these communities are equally as capable of establishing businesses and contributing to revitalization,” Blatto said. “But because of these policy decisions that were made a long time ago, they have limited the ability of people who live in these neighborhoods.”</p>
        <p>The different rates of development between Buffalo communities are directly related to its history of racial segregation. Resources, access, and overall support have scarcely been provided to the black population of Buffalo. The Buffalo government’s dismissal of these communities and their failure of policy improvement are what have led to the underdevelopment of East Side neighborhoods and present-day economic segregation.</p>
        <p>“In communities that struggle with segregation, neighborhood-level revitalization is the key to economic advancement,” Blatto said. “The people who live in the affected communities are most able to provide solutions because they know what their communities need.”</p>
